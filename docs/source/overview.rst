Overview
=========

RVIT stands for Realtime Visualization and Interaction Toolkit. It is an
extension of kivy (http://kivy.org), designed for developing scientific models,
simulations and other artifacts such as teaching tools.

RVIT's primary design goals are to:

* Minimise the amount of additional programming required to include RVI elements

* Minimise the constraints put upon the model (i.e. allow the model to be
  developed with minimal considerations as to how it will be visualized)

* Facilitate rapid prototyping and modification of RVI elements.

The secondary design motivation is to facilitate a greater degree of
interactivity with scientific computational artifacts. Instead of
iteratively (1) running a simuation, (2) visualizing the data generated by the
simulation, (3) modifying a parameter or other aspect of the simulation; RVIT
allows developers to watch their simulation unfold, to perturb, modify and
visualize its variables and parameters on the fly, allowing them to more rapidly
gain an intuitive understanding of the artifact's properties---intuition that
can guide and improve subsequent systematic investigation.
