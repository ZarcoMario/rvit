Overview
=========
RVIT stands for Realtime Visualization and Interaction Toolkit. It is an
extension of kivy (http://kivy.org) that is designed for people who develop
scientific models, simulations and other artifacts such as teaching tools.

The primary design motivation is to make it easy for scientific programmers
to include real-time visualization and interactive (RVI) elements in their
artifacts. RVIT thus aims to:

* Minimise the amount of additional programming required to include RVI elements

* Minimise the constraints put upon the model (i.e. allow the model to be
  developed with minimal considerations as to how it will be visualized)

* Facilitate rapid prototyping and modification of RVI elements.

The secondary design motivation is to facilitate a greater degree of
interactivity with scientific computational artifacts. Instead of
iteratively (1) running a simuation; (2) visualizing the data generated by the
simulation; (3) modifying a parameter or other aspect of the simulation;, RVIT
allows developers to watch their simulation unfold, to perturb and modify its
parameters on the fly, allowing them to more rapidly gain an intuitive
understanding of its properties that can guide subsequent systematic
investigation.
